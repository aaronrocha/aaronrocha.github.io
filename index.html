    Sometimes keeping things simple is the best solution.
</p>
<p>
    Paring things down to just the things that make you happy is key to a better life.
    Do we really need so much stuff in our lifes?
    I think not.

    Almost all the time, we only use a few things that make our life functional.  So in the spirit of simplicity, I will begin my journey.
