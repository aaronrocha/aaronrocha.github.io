<h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
<p>
This is my first thought this morning.  I was thinking about my pay.  
When the President of the United States said that the minimum wage should be
at least $15/hr, he is saying a very important message. 

In my opinion, he is stating that the companies are paying people too little.  Not just minimum pay folks, but everyone.  He is saying in effect that these companies have been taking advantage of us for a long, long time.  He is stating the
sad fact that we are underpaid but also that we allowed them to pay us less than what we are worth!  Why?  

Why have we allowed this to happen?  There has been many studies that show that
companies have enjoyed higher US productivity well beyond what they pay out in '
wages.  I will continue to discover this topic.  I am not done.  

This is only a draft of my line of thinking here.
