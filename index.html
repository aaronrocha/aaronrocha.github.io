<h1>Monday, March 29 2021</h1>
<p>
Today I became aware that it is not about me!  

What do I mean?
People do not worry about me.  
They do not care what I look like.
They do not worry about my problems. 

In fact I think most people worry about their own stuff.  

So, I am now free to explore some more.
