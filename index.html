<h1>Ambition </h1>

<p>
I woke up remembering what I was dreaming about.  I was dreaming about trying to recruit one of my family members into a business I had started.  I can remember how easily I was able to articulate what I wanted to communicate.  But no matteer how good my pitch was, my target was not having any of it.  
</p>
<p>
So I then began to think about what it is to be ambitious.  Unfortunately, I woke up with this on my mind.  I kept on trying to think about ambition.  What is it exactly.  One thing I determined is that one must be exited to reach a goal.  One has to have a goal and or a dream.  Do we all have one?  
</p>
<p>
To try to make this bit short.  I thought ambition comes from having a goal and or a dream.  I can become attractive to my target if I can discover what this goal of theirs is and help them achieve such aspiration.  Then maybe, I can become a good recruiter.  What next?  I will develop open ended questions to draw out information about what drives (motivates) or what goals and dreams I need to help them achieve.
